# Kokoro TTS Deployment Guide - Replace Chatterbox

**Professional voice generation for customer support**

---

## üéØ Why Switch to Kokoro?

### Current Chatterbox Issues:
- ‚ùå Voice too high-pitched
- ‚ùå Speech too fast (unprofessional)
- ‚ùå Sounds robotic for customer support
- ‚ùå Limited control over tone

### Kokoro TTS Benefits:
- ‚úÖ Natural, human-like voice
- ‚úÖ Perfect speed control (0.5x - 2.0x)
- ‚úÖ Adjustable pitch (-1.0 to +1.0)
- ‚úÖ 48 professional voices
- ‚úÖ Designed specifically for customer service
- ‚úÖ CPU-friendly (no GPU required!)
- ‚úÖ Real-time performance (<100ms)
- ‚úÖ 100% free (Apache 2.0)

## üì¶ Installation (RunPod)

### Step 1: SSH to RunPod

```bash
ssh root@<your-runpod-ip>
cd /workspace/chatterbox-twilio-integration
```

### Step 2: Pull Latest Code

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Step 3: Install Kokoro TTS

```bash
pip install kokoro-onnx
```

**That's it!** Only 350MB download.

### Step 4: Test Installation

```bash
python3 scripts/kokoro_tts_engine.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
üéôÔ∏è  Testing: Professional Female (af_heart)
  Style: Professional, warm, reassuring
  Best for: Customer support, appointment reminders
  ‚úì Generated: test_outputs/kokoro_samples/sample_af_heart.wav
  Duration: 30.45s

‚úì Test complete! Audio samples saved to: test_outputs/kokoro_samples
```

### Step 5: Listen to Samples

```bash
# List generated samples
ls -lh test_outputs/kokoro_samples/

# Play a sample (if you have audio forwarding)
# Or download and play locally
scp root@<runpod-ip>:/workspace/chatterbox-twilio-integration/test_outputs/kokoro_samples/*.wav .
afplay sample_af_heart.wav  # macOS
```

## üîß Integration with Your API

### Option A: Quick Integration (Recommended)

Replace the TTS engine in [scripts/server_production.py](scripts/server_production.py):

**BEFORE:**
```python
# Line 86-87
from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS
app.state.tts_model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device=device)
```

**AFTER:**
```python
# Line 86-87
from kokoro_tts_engine import KokoroTTSEngine
app.state.tts_model = KokoroTTSEngine(voice="af_heart")  # Professional female
```

That's it! The API stays the same.

### Option B: Side-by-Side Comparison

Keep both engines and add a parameter to choose:

```python
@app.post("/api/tts")
async def tts(
    text: str,
    voice: str = "professional_female",
    engine: str = "kokoro"  # or "chatterbox"
):
    if engine == "kokoro":
        tts_model = KokoroTTSEngine(voice=voice_config['kokoro_voice'])
        audio = tts_model.generate(
            text,
            speed=voice_config['params']['speed'],
            pitch=voice_config['params']['pitch']
        )
    else:
        # Use old Chatterbox
        ...
```

## üöÄ Quick Test

### Test 1: Generate Single Audio

```bash
python3 << 'EOF'
from scripts.kokoro_tts_engine import KokoroTTSEngine

# Professional female voice (recommended for customer support)
engine = KokoroTTSEngine(voice="af_heart")

# Your appointment reminder text
text = """Good afternoon. This is a friendly reminder from CallWaiting Services.
You have an appointment scheduled for tomorrow at three P M.
Please ensure you arrive fifteen minutes before your scheduled time
and bring any necessary documents with you.
If you need to reschedule, please call us back.
Thank you for choosing CallWaiting Services."""

# Generate with professional settings
audio = engine.generate(
    text,
    speed=0.85,  # Slower = more professional
    pitch=-0.2,  # Lower = more authority
    output_file="appointment_reminder_kokoro.wav"
)

print(f"‚úì Generated {len(audio)} samples ({len(audio)/24000:.2f}s)")
print("‚úì Saved to: appointment_reminder_kokoro.wav")
EOF
```

### Test 2: Compare with Current Voice

```bash
# Generate same text with both engines
python3 << 'EOF'
from scripts.kokoro_tts_engine import KokoroTTSEngine

test_text = "Good afternoon. This is a reminder about your appointment tomorrow."

# Kokoro (new)
kokoro = KokoroTTSEngine(voice="af_heart")
kokoro.generate(test_text, speed=0.85, pitch=-0.2, output_file="test_kokoro.wav")

# Chatterbox (current) - you can compare
# chatterbox = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained()
# chatterbox.generate(test_text, output_file="test_chatterbox.wav")

print("‚úì Generated comparison samples")
EOF

# Download and compare
scp root@<runpod-ip>:/workspace/chatterbox-twilio-integration/test_*.wav .
afplay test_kokoro.wav
# afplay test_chatterbox.wav
```

## üß™ Quality Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Generate 10 test samples with Kokoro
- [ ] Compare with current Chatterbox output
- [ ] Test all voice profiles
- [ ] Verify speed control (0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 1.0)
- [ ] Verify pitch control (-0.4, -0.3, -0.2, 0.0)
- [ ] Test with real appointment reminder text
- [ ] Get feedback from 5 users
- [ ] Measure completion rates
- [ ] Check latency (<200ms)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Module not found: kokoro_onnx"

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install kokoro-onnx
```

### Issue: "Voice files not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Kokoro downloads voices automatically on first use
# Just run the engine once to download
python3 scripts/kokoro_tts_engine.py
```

### Issue: Audio quality poor

**Solution:**
```python
# Try different voice
engine = KokoroTTSEngine(voice="af_bella")  # Instead of af_heart

# Adjust speed (slower = clearer)
audio = engine.generate(text, speed=0.80, pitch=-0.2)
```

### Issue: Too fast/too slow

**Solution:**
```python
# Adjust speed parameter
speed=0.70  # Very slow (meditation)
speed=0.85  # Professional (recommended)
speed=1.00  # Normal
speed=1.15  # Faster (but still clear)
```

2. **Use speed 0.85** for customer support (perfect balance)
3. **Lower pitch slightly** (-0.2) for professional authority
4. **Test with real text** from your appointment reminders
5. **Get user feedback** before full rollout
6. **Monitor latency** to ensure <200ms
7. **Keep Chatterbox** installed for fallback (first week)
