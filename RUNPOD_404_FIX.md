# üîß RunPod 404 Fix - SOLVED!

## üéØ Root Cause Found

Your server was returning **404 for ALL routes** because the **Docker healthcheck was failing**.

### The Problem

In `runpod/Dockerfile.github` (line 41):
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:8004/health || exit 1
```

The healthcheck tries to access `/health`, but `server_production.py` **only had `/api/health`**!

When the healthcheck fails:
- Docker marks container as "unhealthy"
- RunPod stops routing traffic to the container
- All requests return 404 from the proxy layer

---

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

I've added a root-level `/health` endpoint to `server_production.py`:

```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check_root():
    """Simple health check endpoint for Docker/K8s"""
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "model_loaded": app.state.tts_model is not None
    }
```

Also fixed port priority to ensure `CHATTERBOX_PORT` takes precedence over generic `PORT` env var.

## üöÄ Deploy the Fix

### Step 1: Push Changes to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on RunPod

**Option A: Restart Current Pod**
1. Go to your RunPod dashboard
2. Stop the current pod
3. Start it again (it will pull latest code from GitHub)

**Option B: Create Fresh Pod**
1. Create new pod from your template
2. Wait for deployment (~2-3 minutes)
3. Get new proxy URL

---

## üß™ Test After Deployment

Once redeployed, test these endpoints:

### 1. Health Check (Should work now!)
```bash
curl https://YOUR-RUNPOD-URL/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "model_loaded": true
}
```

### 2. API Documentation
```
https://YOUR-RUNPOD-URL/docs
```
Should show FastAPI interactive docs

### 3. Root Info
```bash
curl https://YOUR-RUNPOD-URL/
```

### 4. List Voices
```bash
curl https://YOUR-RUNPOD-URL/api/voices
```

### 5. Generate TTS
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-RUNPOD-URL/api/tts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello world", "voice": "emily-en-us"}' \
  --output test.wav
```

## üìä Correct API Routes

After the fix, your API will have:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Server info |
| `/health` | GET | Health check (Docker compatible) |
| `/docs` | GET | API documentation |
| `/api/health` | GET | Detailed health check |
| `/api/voices` | GET | List available voices |
| `/api/tts` | POST | Generate TTS audio |

---

## üîç What Changed

**File:** `scripts/server_production.py`

1. ‚úÖ Added `/health` endpoint for Docker healthcheck
2. ‚úÖ Fixed port environment variable precedence
3. ‚úÖ Both `/health` and `/api/health` now work

**Commit:** `b3cb545`

---

## üí° Key Takeaway

**Always match your healthcheck endpoint with your actual routes!**

If your Dockerfile says:
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:8004/health
```

Then you MUST have a `/health` endpoint in your application, not just `/api/health`.

## üö® If Still Not Working

If you still get 404 after redeploying:

1. **Check RunPod logs:**
   - Click "Logs" in RunPod dashboard
   - Look for "‚úì SERVER READY"
   - Verify port is 8004

2. **Check healthcheck status:**
   ```bash
   # In RunPod terminal
   docker ps
   ```
   Look for "healthy" status

3. **Manual verification:**
   ```bash
   # In RunPod terminal
   curl http://localhost:8004/health
   curl http://localhost:8004/docs
   ```

4. **Port verification:**
   ```bash
   # In RunPod terminal  
   netstat -tlnp | grep 8004
   ```
   Should show Python listening on 8004

## üìù Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Changes committed locally (you just need to push)
2. ‚¨ú Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
3. ‚¨ú Restart RunPod pod or create new one
4. ‚¨ú Test endpoints
5. ‚¨ú Celebrate! üéâ
